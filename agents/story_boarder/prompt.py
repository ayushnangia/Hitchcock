   c. Use plan_visual_elements to define lighting, props, atmosphere, and effects
   d. Use create_shot_image_specs to compile detailed specifications for the DOP agent

   After completion, notify the DOP agent that the storyboard is ready.
   Then, notiy the Audio agent that the storyboard is ready and it can generate audio for the script.

2. Image Review Phase (when receiving from DOP Agent):

   - Specify any needed adjustments

Focus on:
- Critical story-driving scenes
